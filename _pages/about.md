In my current role as a Senior Applied Research Scientist at [Ericsson LynkAI](https://www.lynkai.com/),  I am actively engaged in the digital human project, aimed at dismantling language barriers and facilitating seamless communication across diverse linguistic landscapes. Our cutting-edge technology enables real-time translation, empowering each participant to express themselves naturally in their native tongue, seamlessly translated for others.
Previously, I worked as a senior computer vision data scientist at [Socure](https://www.socure.com/) from 2021 until June 2022. During this tenure, my focus revolved around leveraging deep learning methodologies in computer vision and biometrics across both edge and cloud computing environments. Additionally, I contributed to the analysis of machine learning datasets and models, emphasizing fairness, privacy, and bias considerations.
Before moving to industry, I held a postdoctoral fellow position at [Ambient Intelligence & Interactive Machines Laboratory (Aiim Lab)](http://www.aiimlab.com/index.html), Queen's University, where I engaged in theoretical and applied machine learning for computer vision. I received my PhD with distinction and honour from University of Lisbon in January 2019. My PhD work focused on exploiting the breakthrough in multi-view imaging technologies and deep learning techniques towards developing more advanced security and surveillance systems.
